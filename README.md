Dataset Creator includes the codes that preprocesses the data and creates the dataset into a format that is suitable for Pytorch.

Other directories contain training codes for every model.
For FaceNet model model code and weights are taken from: https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch
For facial landmark data loading and transform functions Pytorch tutorial codes are used:https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html

Saliencymap code uses resnet model and generates a saliency map.
