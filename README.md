# Deep-Vision-Class-Project

Dataset Creator includes the codes that preprocesses the data and creates the dataset into a format that is suitable for Pytorch.

Other directories contain training codes for every model.

For FaceNet model model code and weights are taken from: https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch 

For facial landmark data loading and transform functions Pytorch tutorial codes are used:https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html 

Saliencymap code uses resnet model and generates a saliency map. 

VAE and GAN directory contains codes for VAE and GAN. VAE codes are taken from:https://github.com/dpernes/vae and GAN codes are based on Pytorch's DCGAN tutorial:https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html
